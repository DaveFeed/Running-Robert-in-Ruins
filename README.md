# VK Music RPC for Discord
A small project I did while having fun with friends.<br>
This mini game is about one of my friends and his teacher having a fight.<br>
It just a sample of me trying new languages and just having fun.<br>

### Instalation
### Packing the code yourself
- Download the source code
- Run `Running Robert in Ruins.sln` via Visual Studio
- Start the project, and you will have an executable file in `Running Robert in Ruins/bin/Debug/Running Robert in Ruins.exe`

You can download the latest build from [releases](https://github.com/DaveFeed/Running-Robert-in-Ruins/releases). 

Currently there are many bugs and not so good mechanics, but it was just a test of the language, its syntax and capability.
There is also a tutorial in Settings.
